-- ATN M_G = (Q, Sigma, Delta, E, F)
-- Q is the set of states (atnQ). ATN states are represented as nodes.
-- Sigma is the edge alphabet N U T U Pi U M (atnSigma)
-- Delta is the transition relation mapping Q x (Sigma U e) -> Q (atnDelta)
--       Transitions are represented as edges.
-- E is the set of submachine entry states (stored in NodeType as Entry)
-- F is the set of submachine final states (stored in NodeType as Final)
